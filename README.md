# Vanilla-Numpy-AI-
This repository is designed to explore AI algorithms using pure Python and Numpy. It includes small neural networks trained with backpropagation, allowing users to see how forward and backward passes work. Experiments include linear regression and simple classification tasks to demonstrate AI concepts step by step.
